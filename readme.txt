== Description ==

Generates a separate partial feed for Facebook. Use it to direct Facebook visitors to your blog while leaving your main full-text feed intact.

If you're a Facebook user and you're unhappy with the way it handles your feed, use this plugin to generate a special excerpts only version for Facebook.
It will also add a link to your blog post beneath the excerpt in case visitors miss the 'View original post' link Facebook provides.
